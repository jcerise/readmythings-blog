<p>Dungeon Crawler is a simple (but rapidly growing more complex) roguelike game, written in Python, and utilizing the 
<a href="http://doryen.eptalys.net/libtcod/"i>Doryen library (libtcod)</a>. As far as roguelikes go, its fairly complete, and
relatively true to its origins (or at least it will be, there are things like some mouse controls I would like to remove eventually).
You are cast as an adventurer, trekking through a perilous dungeon in search of...something (haven't added an end game yet). Along
the way, you will encounter fearsome monsters, find magical treasures, and prove your worth as the greatest adventurer of all time.</p>

<p>The game is still a work in progress, but all the sources can be found on github. I'm actively developing on the game, as there are 
quite a few features that still want to add. I've outlined a roadmap for the game below, so you can get an idea of where I would like
to take the game (eventually).</p>
