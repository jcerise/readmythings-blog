<p>Here you can find descriptions (and links to repositories) of some of the projects I am currently working on. This list is not complete, as
I have projects that I only work on occasionally, and I did not see fit to list them here. This is a list of my active endeavors. If you are
looking for a link to my github page, you can find that above, in the header.</p>
